# LabNotes (Legacy)
Legacy code, zipped up for archive purposes.


## Description

Distribute MacOS 'mobileconfig' Policies to AD bound Macs via the Active Directory group notes field

The ability to administratively install profiles from the command-line has been removed in MacOS 11 and later, making the LabNotes code legacy.

No longer in development.
